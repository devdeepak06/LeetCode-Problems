//Problem: Given an array of integers, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to a specific target.
//You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.
//Example: Given nums = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9, Because nums[0] + nums[1] = 2 + 7 = 9, return [0, 1].
//Solution: Brute Force
//Difficulty: Easy

package arrays;

//Approach 1: Brute Force

// The brute force approach is simple. Loop through each element xx and find if there is another value that equals to target - xtargetâˆ’x.
// Time complexity : O(n^2). For each element, we try to find its complement by looping through the rest of array which takes O(n) time.
// Therefore, the time complexity is O(n^2).
// Space complexity : O(1).
// Difficulty: Easy
// Time Complexity: O(n^2)
// Space Complexity: O(1)
